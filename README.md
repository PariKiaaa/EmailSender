# EmailSender #

This Python script provides a simple GUI application using tkinter to send emails via Gmail. The application allows users to enter their Gmail credentials, recipient email addresses (separated by commas), subject, and the body of the email. The email is sent securely using the Gmail SMTP server.

## Requirements ##
- Python 3
- tkinter

## How to Use ##
1. Clone the repository or download the `EmailSender.py` file.
2. Run the script.
3. The GUI window will appear.
4. Enter your Gmail address and password in the respective fields.
5. In the "To" field, enter the email addresses of recipients, separated by commas.
6. Enter the subject of the email in the "Subject" field.
7. Write the body of the email in the "Body" text box.
8. Click the "Send Email" button to send the email.

## Important Note ##
This application uses the Gmail SMTP server to send emails. As a result, you need to enable "Allow less secure apps" in your Gmail account settings or use an App Password (if two-factor authentication is enabled) to successfully send emails. Exercise caution and avoid entering your Gmail credentials on untrusted or public systems.
